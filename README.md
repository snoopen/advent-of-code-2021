My humble javascript solutions to Advent of Code 2021
## usage
Solutions can be run with just `node day_NN`, which will take the corresponding `day_NN.txt` input from the `input` folder. Run with `node day_NN sample` to use the internal sample data.

All solutions should work with any input. Except, I think, for day 24 which has the logic hand decoded out of the puzzle input.
